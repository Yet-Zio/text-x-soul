# Comparison:
### Please note that this file will be used for comparison of Soul and different formats regularly based on new formats and releases

## Between Soul and INI
What we can gather from **INI** files are that the ***INI file format*** is an informal standard for configuration files of computing platforms and software. INI files are simple text files with a basic structure composed of sections, properties, and values.

## Comparing by the number of lines
`Note that this is not much of a good comparison, as many people **disagree** in comparing lines of code. Rather comparing with how they work is what matters.`

The conclusion is that **Soul** and **INI** are functioning quite similar in terms of keys. But in terms of sections or groups, **Soul** takes an overhead. In most of the examples, **Soul** and **INI** took the same number of lines but different number of bytes used for data.

But this could matter in larger files.

-  Ignoring comments and unwanted spaces.

`examples/inifiles/example.ini`
```ini
[owner]
name=John Doe
organization=Acme Widgets Inc.
[database]
server=192.0.2.62     
port=143
file="payroll.dat"
```
It takes up **7 lines of code**, having 114 characters, which makes up 114 bytes of data.

`examples/inifiles/example.soul`
```soul
owner() = {name, organization}
name@(owner) = John Doe
organization@(owner) = Acme Widgets Inc.
database() = {server, port, file}
server@(database) = 192.0.2.62
port@(database) = 143
file@(database) = "payroll.dat"
```
It takes up **7 lines of code**, having 214 characters, which makes up 214 bytes of data.

## Comparing by handling of data

Let's take the previous examples:
`examples/inifiles/example.ini`
```ini
[owner]
name=John Doe
organization=Acme Widgets Inc.
[database]
server=192.0.2.62     
port=143
file="payroll.dat"
```
The values are grouped as sections, similar to groups in Soul. However these groups are **parser-dependent**. They depend on values required by the keys. That is, A default specific value is required. Moreover, the same value cannot be overriden after the section declaration. However, INI requires less space for declaring these.

`examples/inifiles/example.soul`
```soul
owner() = {name, organization}
name@(owner) = John Doe
organization@(owner) = Acme Widgets Inc.
database() = {server, port, file}
server@(database) = 192.0.2.62
port@(database) = 143
file@(database) = "payroll.dat"
```
In soul, the required group values are defined as parameters and later provided a value anywhere in the file. These are not **parser-dependent**. That is, A default specific value is not required by the parameters. Moreover, the same group variable-value or parameter value can be overriden anywhere in the file.

## Between Soul and XML

The conclusion is that both **Soul** and **XML** are not comparable and function in a different way, but similar cases like value declarations can be compared.

**Soul** still has a long way to become a widely-acceptable format.

In most of these cases **Soul** took less space.

## Comparing by the number of lines
`Note that this is not much of a good comparison, as many people **disagree** in comparing lines of code. Rather comparing with how they work is what matters.`

But this could matter in larger files.

It takes up **24 lines of code** if you could count which has 1187 characters, making up 1187 bytes of data.

`examples/cmp/order.xml`
```xml
<PurchaseOrder xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
    <ItemsOrders>

            <ItemPrice>2.89</ItemPrice>
        </Item>
    </ItemsOrders>
</PurchaseOrder>
```
Code is **contained** within **user-defined tags**, these cannot be **overriden within that group**. This code took about **12 lines of code** which has 384 characters, making up 384 bytes of data.

`example/cmp/order.soul`
```soul
PurchaseOrder() = {ItemsOrders}
ItemsOrders() = {Item1, Item2}
Item1() = {ItemID, ItemPrice}
Item2() = {ItemID, ItemPrice}
ItemID@(Item1) = aaa111
ItemPrice@(Item1) = 34.22
ItemID@(Item2) = bbb222
ItemPrice@(Item2) = 2.89
```

Code is **not contained**. Values can be overriden anytime, anywhere in the file. This code took about **8 lines of code** which has 223 characters, making up 223 bytes of data.
