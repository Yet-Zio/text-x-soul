# IMPLEMENTATIONS AND IMPLEMENTING : 0.5.2
## IMPLEMENTATIONS
Implementations done by people are in public domain and functioning may vary.

Implementations exist for the following:
- Qt C++(In progress)
The reason Im doing it in Qt, is its easier to come up with a solution ASAP so that everyone can understand how it works and come up with different solutions, even far far better than mine.

Upcoming Implementations are for the following:
- Native C/C++
- Python

Implementation requests:
These are requests for implementing in the following languages/frameworks:
- Java
- PHP
- (Maybe others too)


## IMPLEMENTING
As long as this project is in public domain, you can do whatever with this project, extend the current format with your own standard, provide new identifiers and things to make the project better for all. If you don't have any ideas on how to extend, then maybe you want to look at [Extending Format](extend.md).
